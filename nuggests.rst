    “In my life, it’s been a lot about hard work and focus and study and very
    concentrated study, not about – you know – lots of interruptions, I’m guilty
    as anyone — but I turn my phone off or turn the buzzer off and make it
    unavailable for a good six hours a day. And I work — I still work. I like
    programming, I like doing things that are productive.”

    - Jim Clark

    So the way to manage yourself is that when you have a real important problem
    you don't let anything else get the center of your attention - you keep your
    thoughts on the problem. Keep your subconscious starved so it has to work on
    your problem, so you can sleep peacefully and get the answer in the morning,
    free.
