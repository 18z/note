    This early learning of how to do things one tiny little step at a time. I
    learned to not worry so much about the outcome, but to concentrate on the step
    I was on and to try to do it as perfectly as I could when I was doing it.

    “In my life, it’s been a lot about hard work and focus and study and very
    concentrated study, not about – you know – lots of interruptions, I’m guilty
    as anyone — but I turn my phone off or turn the buzzer off and make it
    unavailable for a good six hours a day. And I work — I still work. I like
    programming, I like doing things that are productive.”

    - Jim Clark
